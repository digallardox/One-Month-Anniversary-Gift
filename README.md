# One-Month-Anniversary-Gift
A fun project to give to my girlfriend of one month. The code creates a digital typewriter effect with the text you enter. The JS file automatically tracks the sentence length and adjusts the typewriter to work with whatever text you enter. The CSS is designed to make everything seemless and changes can be quickly made with the :root element. Please enjoy!
